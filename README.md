# OneCenter + SignalWire

This is the frontend implemtation of OneCenter with Signalwire for TadHack

- API and SignalWire Relay Consumer [API/RELAY-CONSUMER](https://github.com/onecenterai/signal-wire-api)
- Demo Phone Number: +12065897026
## How it works

- The number is connected to a sample partner on the OneCenter platform
- When called, our relay consumer pick up the call and query our AI to get the best possible response
- And the conversation continues until the user ends the call.
- The conversation can be about a problem the caller is having with the partner product or service
- The caller can get his or her queries resolved on the call
